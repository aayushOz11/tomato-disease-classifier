# tomato-disease-classifier
This project is a tomato disease classifier using machine learning algorithms like random forest and XGBoost
The steps to run this classifier are:

Step 1 : download the data from kaggle

Step 2 : Split data into training and testing sets. Keep in mind the computation power of your PCs and select number of training examples accordingly. 
Here, I have taken 400 training images per calss and 100 testing images per class.

Step 3 : Provide the path to training and testing images folders in the code and run all the blocks of code.
